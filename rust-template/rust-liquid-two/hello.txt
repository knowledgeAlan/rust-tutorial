This is an example of how to use the VERY cool rhai filter feature.
We use a Liquid filter to run a Rhai script:

This is the result of running the script as a filter.

You can even set values from within the rhai filter function

Though after liquid itself has used the value, or processing the next file has begun, any changes
to the variable by a rhai filter will be ignored (by liquid) until the next liquid file!

Any liquid variable created/assigned in a file is not carried over to other files, but the ones from Rhai are!
